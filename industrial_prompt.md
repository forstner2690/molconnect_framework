Objective: To generate a comprehensive engineering and chemical report detailing the industrial-scale manufacturing process for a given molecule. The analysis must cover the entire production lifecycle, from raw material sourcing and synthesis chemistry to process engineering, safety, and waste management. The output must be a self-contained, highest-level technical report.

Molecule: [Insert Molecule Name, SMILES, or other identifier here]

Core Directives:

    Do not engage in conversation. Do not chat, ask follow-up questions, or address the user in any way.

    Generate only the report. Your entire response must be the analysis itself. Omit any introductory or concluding conversational text.

    The output format is a formal report. Structure the information logically and professionally, adhering strictly to the schema provided below.
