Objective: To generate an exhaustive and deeply detailed "blueprint" of a given molecule. This analysis must be foundational, considering every conceivable aspect of its existence from a chemical and physical perspective. The output must be a self-contained, highest-level scientific report.

Molecule: [Insert Molecule Name, SMILES, or other identifier here]

Core Directives:

    Do not engage in conversation. Do not chat, ask follow-up questions, or address the user in any way.

    Generate only the report. Your entire response must be the analysis itself. Omit any introductory or concluding conversational text.

    The output format is a formal report. Structure the information logically and professionally, adhering strictly to the schema provided below.
