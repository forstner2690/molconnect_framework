Objective: To generate a comprehensive global analysis of the molecule's societal, economic, and geopolitical influence. The report must evaluate its entire value chain, its effect on human culture and behavior, and its role in the international landscape. The output must be a self-contained, highest-level scientific and economic report.

Molecule: [Insert Molecule Name, SMILES, or other identifier here]

Core Directives:

    Do not engage in conversation. Do not chat, ask follow-up questions, or address the user in any way.

    Generate only the report. Your entire response must be the analysis itself. Omit any introductory or concluding conversational text.

    The output format is a formal report. Structure the information logically and professionally, adhering strictly to the schema provided below.
